# Polymer libraries, description

# Polymer libraries #

Polymer libraries is a project to collect and share some simple and useful libraries to analyze molecular dynamics simulations.  Many routines written here apply only to the model that is described in the references although there are several routine that can be applied to any kind of polymer since the routine just need the "x y z" of the polymer itself.


# Details #
Polymer libraries contain code that allow you to calculate:


- Radius of gyration


- End to end distance


- Contact map (optimized in NlogN time)


- Distance map


- Writhe of a polymer


- Twist of a polymer


- Linking number


- Remapping to remove periodic boundary conditions


- Track the evolution of observable and estimate their error with the binning method
